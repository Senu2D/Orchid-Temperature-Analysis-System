# Orchid-Temperature-Analysis-System
A C++ application analyzing temperature variations to optimize orchid growth, featuring data input, analysis, storage, conversion, and user testing.

Overview
This C++ application is designed for Orchi-flora Planters to monitor and analyze temperature variations essential for optimal orchid growth. Since orchids require a specific day-night temperature fluctuation (10-15Â°F) to bloom properly, this system helps track, calculate, and analyze temperature data over a month and Data will save to the temperature_data.txt file.

Key Features
- Daily Temperature Logging: Stores daytime and nighttime temperatures for each day of the month.
- Temperature Fluctuation Analysis: Calculates daily fluctuations and monthly averages.
- Temperature Statistics: Determines maximum/minimum daytime and nighttime temperatures.
- Suitability Check: Analyzes if temperature variations meet the ideal growth conditions.
- Temperature Converter: Converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- User-Friendly Interface: A menu-driven program with proper error handling for easy navigation.

This system ensures accurate monitoring, helping Orchi-flora Planters determine the best climate conditions for high-quality orchid blooms.
